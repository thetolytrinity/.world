WIP 3D portfolio page
dumping all of my ideas in one spot, social media is fun but i wanted a spot just for me....
I wanted to be able to portray my work with as much flare and personality as possible
so naturally whilst learning blender, picking up javascript and 3JS came with the package,
admitedly i use chat GPT to help me with certain parts as originally this is essentially meant to be a side project
on my fashion projects, but learning/writing code was always on my ever growing long list of things
ive always wanted to do, albeit here we are.
